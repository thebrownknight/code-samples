Project 3 - Routing Lab
/**********************************************************

Work Distribution: I completed all portions of the project.  I only had to do one of the two routing algorithms so I chose the Distance Vector routing algorithm (as was agreed upon by Professor Lange via email).  

Notes: I added some things to routesim.cc so make sure this is replaced in your set of files.  I'll send all of my files so it might be better to just use my files cohesively because I might have made some alterations in a couple other files that I don't remember at the moment.
